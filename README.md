# Sorting Algorithms Simulation App
** I'm still working on this project
This is small text base application project for me to review and implement some sorting algorithms. This app will allow user to simulate with various sorting algorithms. 
This app contains following algorithms so far.......
1. bubble sort
2. insertion sort
3. selection sort
4. quick sort 
5. merge sort
6. counting sort
